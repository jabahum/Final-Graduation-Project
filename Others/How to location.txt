CI (cell identity) = xXYYZ, where
xX: BSC number
YY: BTS number within the BSC
Z: Cell number within the BTS
Z=0 for the omni site, Z=(1-3) for the sectoral site.

CGI (cell global identification) = MCC-MNC-LAC-CI, where
MCC=AAA: mobile country code
MNC=BB: mobile network code
LAC=ccCCC: location area code
CI: cell id (see above)

For example, CGI = 452 02 341 5012

452=MCC of Vietnam
02=MNC of VinaPhone network
341=LAC
5012=CI
This is the second cell of the BTS-1 in the BSC-5.
